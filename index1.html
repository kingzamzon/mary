        I am Lydia Brain and I am a health practitioner at the Lagos state teaching hospital. 
    </p>

    <p>
        I have worked in the cardiac care unit for over 5 years, where I deal with hundreds of heart patients daily.
    </p>

    <p>
        Visiting the hospital every time can be tirely 
    </p>

    <p>
        And can even cause depression
    </p>

    <p>
        What I am about to show you will change your life forever
    </p>

    <p>
        Amaka is one of my patients at the cardiac care unit and for years she has had to live with the fear of dying
    </p>

    <p>
        Several times she cried on my shoulder and all I could do was part her on the back
    </p>

    <p>
        One day she angrily said to me, 
    </p>

    <p>
        "What if I die before I could have my heart test?"
    </p>

    <p>
        What if I can't afford to regularly pay my hospital bills?
    </p>

    <p>
        Why do I have to always visit the hospital?
    </p>

    <p>
        I hate it!"
    </p>

    <p>
        The whole CCU unit was in chaos that day    
    </p>

    <p>
        And it took a lot to calm Amaka calm
    </p>

    <p>
        It was that day a colleague introduced Amaka to a lifesaver that could help her monitor her heart 
        condition without visiting the hospital every time
    </p>

    <p>
        Amaka literally went from being overly sad to living with peace of 
        mind and saving more money for her other needs.
